# Hackathon Theme - Hack The Planet

# Project Name : Adaptive Irrigation Control
# Project Idea : An Efficient Water Management System for Various Crops based on the Requirement and Climatic Conditions

# Features :
* Calculation and Exact Water Amount for the Respective Crop - based on the plant data
* Monitoring the Climatic conditions - Humitidity (Atmosphere & Soil), Temperature
* Monitors activity near the plants using a motion sensor to prevent any intrusion (Export Frequency, Time, Trigger Buzzer)
* Monitors the Light conditions over the plants - to measure the exposure to proper sunlight over the crops for a particular duration
* LEDs and Buzzers at the IOT Hardware and the application to ensure proper alert
* An Descriptive Application in Android and a Skill in Alexa - Which provides stats, water timings for the crops and the detail of the crop lifecycle
# Future :
* Data Analysis of the Pattern of Climatic conditions and Crop Habitat for efficient growth - Data Collected based on time of use


# Tools Used :
* Intel Edison and Grove IOT Starter Kit Powered by AWS
* Language - Javascript
